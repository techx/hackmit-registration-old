After you confirm your email, make sure to fill out the lottery application! You can continue to update your application until midnight on July 20th, at which time we'll run the lottery. If you are accepted, we will send out more details on how to complete your registration. Please email team@hackmit.org if you have any questions.

Also, if you haven't already, try to crack the HackMIT admissions puzzle! The starting point is located somewhere on our website. If you're quick enough to solve it, you'll guarantee yourself (and your team) a spot at this year's HackMIT! Heads up though, several of your fellow hackers have already claimed puzzle codes!

Sincerely,
The HackMIT Team
