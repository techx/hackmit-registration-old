hackmit-registration-old
==========
This is the old HackMIT Registration System used for HackMIT 2014

Ground rules
-----------
1. We're using git flow. Always develop on a feature branch (branch off of develop and name appropriately) and submit pull requests back to develop when you're ready to pull your code in.
2. Test thoroughly! Aim for full coverage of code paths and user behaviors; ask team members for testing support. Always test before you push.
3. Don't push secret keys or non-public information of any kind. Put those into separate config files that aren't committed or pushed (use the .gitignore to cover yourself!)
4. Before committing or pushing ask yourself...
    - Did I add all the files I meant to? (git status)
    - Do I have a clear-cut message on what I am committing?
    - Am I on the right branch?

Projects
------------
Use separate folders for different projects. Current projects:
1. website - This is the HackMIT website. HackMIT-specific related code is in a separate repo.
